                           We do not exclude or limit our liability to you where it would be illegal to do so. This includes any of our liability for fraud or making fraudulent misrepresentation in operating the Platform or providing the products or services we offer. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you are using the Platform as a consumer, in some countries or jurisdictions you may have certain legal rights as a consumer. In such cases, nothing in these terms limit your legal rights as a consumer that may not be waived by contract.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Other than the types of liabilities that we cannot limit by law, the liabilities of Our Entities to you (on aggregate) are limited to the amount you have paid us (if any) for the use of our Platform or for any products or services we offer over the last twelve (12) months.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>YOUR REPRESENTATION</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                    </ul>
                    <h4>INDEMNITY</h4>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You also agree to fully cooperate with us in the defence or settlement of any claim in relation to or arising out of our Platform or these terms.

                    </ul>
                    <h4>TERMINATION</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            These terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or us as follows.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You may stop using the Platform any time by deactivating your account.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to our Platform, if we reasonably believe:
                            <ul className="infoPage__insideList">
                                <li>
                                    you are in serious or repeated breach of these terms (including a prolonged failure to settle any payment);
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    you are using the Platform in a manner that would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us, other users, or the public;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    we are requested to do so by government or regulatory authorities or as required under applicable laws, regulations or legal processes; or
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                our provision of the Platform to you is no longer possible or commercially viable.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In any of the above cases, we will notify you by the email address associated with your account or at the next time you attempt to access your account, unless we are prohibited from notifying you by law.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Upon termination of your access, these terms will also terminate except for Clause to 19.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Where we consider necessary or appropriate, we will report any breach of these terms (or the Acceptable Use Policy) to law enforcement authorities and we will cooperate with such authorities by disclosing your identity and providing any information about you within our systems to them.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                           These terms constitute the entire agreement between any user and us in relation to the use of or any transactions on the Platform. These terms supersede and extinguish all other agreements, promises, assurances, warranties, representations and understandings between any user and us, whether written or oral, in relation to the use of or any transactions on the Platform. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You acknowledge that you will have no remedies in respect of any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in these terms.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will contact you to let you know if we plan to do this. If you do not wish to continue the contract with the transferee, you may contact us to end the contract within one (1) calendar month of us informing you of the proposed transfer and we will refund you any payments you have made in advance for any products not provided.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person if we agree to this in writing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force. Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the products, we can still require you to make the payment at a later date.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
